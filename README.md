Good luck üçÄ


1. Clone the repository on your local machine (Place the project in the htdocs folder).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/islacrur/isla-cruanes-dev-portfolio.git
```
2. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
3. Install project dependencies with 
```bash
npm install
``` 
4. Start the application
```bash
npm start
```
The application should now be running on `localhost:3000`.
5. Download the Node.js installer from [officialwebsite](https://nodejs.org/en) and choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
6. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Accept the license terms and choose the installation location. You can also customize the components to be installed, such as npm, the Node.js package manager.
7. Once the installation is complete, verify that Node.js and npm have been installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the commands node -v and npm -v. You should see the versions of Node.js and npm you have installed.
9. Navigate to the "backend" directory.
```bash
cd backend
```
10. Run the following command
```bash
composer install
```
11. Create a database named "portfolio" in phpMyAdmin.
12. Then copy the Configuration File:
```bash
cp .env.example . env.
```
 Configure your file . env with details of your environment, such as the connection to the database.
13. Then you must generate the Application Key with the following command 
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
14. Then run Migrations and Seeds with the following command

php artisan serve
```
 The application will be available in http://localhost:8000 (or on the port specified by the console).
